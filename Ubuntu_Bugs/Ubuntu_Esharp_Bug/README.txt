Ubuntu e# bug
Known to affect:
Operating Systems

    • Ubuntu 22.04 (System76 Pangolin)
    • Ubuntu 22.04.1 (System76 Pangolin)

Description:
This bug will occur `<instance>` and will prevent any input, instead showing the characters e# with an underscore. I originally thought it lasted for the rest of the session, but it turns out it can be mitigated without restarting. I have lost work in the past, and would love to have known I could have mitigated it.
Steps to reproduce:
    • Unknown
Steps to mitigate:
1. Emoji menu
    • a. Open a program capable of inserting Emojis
    • b. Open the Emoji menu (inserting an emoji is optional)
    • c. Fixed for now
2. Simple restart
    • a. Restart your computer
    • b. Hope it doesn't come back within 5 minutes
